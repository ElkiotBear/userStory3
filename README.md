# user story 3

- npm install
- npm run dev

1. What I did

- homepage alert
- user profile preview public bio

2. what i'm stuck at

- next.js can't use addEventListener('resize) so it messes up when I try to make the window small. and I write a funtion(in components folder publicBio folder useWidth.js) to solve that problem but it didn't work. I can console.log my window's width but the value can't use in css

3. what i want to do next

- the rest of the page
